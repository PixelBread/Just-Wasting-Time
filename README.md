# Just Wasting Time
Absolutely nothing important happens here.
This is a completely useless project, made purely for the art of wasting time in the most unproductive way possible.
Perfect for when you want to look busy while doing absolutely nothing of value.
No goals, no roadmap, no productivity, just pure unapologetic time wasting.

# Fake Loading
A masterpiece of illusion.
This project simulates the thrill of waiting for something that will never actually happen.
It is a 100% authentic fake loading screen experience, perfect for pranks, demos, or simply making people question their life choices while staring at a progress bar that goes nowhere.
